//! # Use ws2812 leds via spi
//!
//! - For usage with `smart-leds`
//! - Implements the `SmartLedsWrite` trait
//!
//! Needs a type implementing the `spi::FullDuplex` trait.
//!0
//! The spi peripheral should run at 4MHz. Each neopixel bit is 5 SPI bits. 
//! In this way the neopixel timing is exact 800 Khrz, and the timing for the low and high bits
//! is within the specification. 
//!            specification (ns)      this variant (ns)      lib.rs variant (ns)
//! low bit:   800/450                 725/500                 999/333
//! high bit   400/850                 500/750                 333/999
//! frequency  800 Khz                 800Khz                  750 Khz
//! 
//! The max deviation for the timing here is 100 ns, where the max deviation of the timing in lib.rs
//! is 199 us. 
//! 
//! Due to the use of half duplex, the tx fifo of the spi is optimal used , so 6 neopixel bits (== 30 spi bits) 
//! can be stored in the fifo.
//! 
//! During the calculation of the next pixel one can see that the bit pattern is stretched (at 16 mhz cpu clock), 
//! so calculation takes longer than the six neopixel bits in the fifo (longer than 6 * 1.25 us = 7.5 us).
//! 
//! Note that the 5 bit pattern always has a zero at the beginning and the end. In this way stretching  will always 
//! happen during a zero phase. The zero phase is less time sensitive than the one phase.
//!  
//! This variant can run on a cpu clock of 16 Mhz and multiples (32, 64)
//! 
//! Note that this halfduplex variant can only run with a feature branch of the hal.
//! where the fullduplex spi can be switched to half duplex output mode and 5 bits wide operation
//! An example how to use this variant can be found in the examples of this feature branch see
//! https://github.com/smeenka/rust-examples/blob/master/nucleo-G070/examples/neopixel5bits.rs
